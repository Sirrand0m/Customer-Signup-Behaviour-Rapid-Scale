# Customer Signup Behaviour Analysis — Rapid Scale

## 📄 Project Overview  
This repository contains the analysis of customer-signup behaviour data for a fictional company, “Rapid Scale.” The goal was to clean, audit, and analyse customer signup data to derive insights into user acquisition trends and data quality.

## 🚀 Contents  
- `customer_signups.csv` — the raw customer signup dataset.  
- `Week1_Workbook.ipynb` — a Jupyter Notebook containing the full data cleaning, processing, audit steps and exploratory analysis.  
- `Customer Sign-Up Behaviour Report.pdf` — a short non-technical report summarizing key findings and insights from the data analysis.

## 🧰 What was done  
- Cleaned and validated the raw signup data (handling missing values, type conversions, duplicates, data integrity checks).  
- Conducted a data-quality audit to assess completeness and consistency.  
- Performed exploratory analysis to uncover user-acquisition trends over time (e.g. signup rates, growth patterns, demographic breakdowns if present).  
- Derived summary statistics and visualizations to support insights into the signup process and user acquisition behaviour.

## 🔎 Key Insights (summary)  
*(See the report for full details)*  
- Highlighted periods of increased signup activity, shedding light on potential acquisition peaks.  
- Identified data-quality issues that could impact downstream analysis — e.g. missing or inconsistent entries — potentially informing improved data collection practices.

## 🧑‍💻 How to run / reproduce  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Load `customer_signups.csv` in a Python environment supporting pandas.  
3. Open and run `Week1_Workbook.ipynb` to follow the full data cleaning and analysis pipeline.  
4. Inspect the generated outputs and visualizations — or regenerate them after modifications.  

## 📄 Report & Documentation  
The PDF report synthesizes the cleaned data results, summarises main findings, and discusses implications of the data-quality audit.  

## ⚠️ Notes on Data  
- The dataset is fictional and provided solely for demonstration and learning purposes.  
- No external or personal data sources are involved.
